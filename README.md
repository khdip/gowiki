# gowiki

This is a simple web application I created when learning Go.
I created the web app with the help from this wiki page: https://go.dev/doc/articles/wiki/

You can run the wiki executable file or run the wiki.go file by running the command 
> go run wiki.go

Then you can go to localhost:8080/view/aSamplePage. You can write something in the textbox and save it.
The writings will be saved in a .txt file.
